I'm Halil Cetiner, also known as [bayneri](https://www.x.com/bayneri).

I'm a software engineer based in London.

I currently work at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/), focused on reliability engineering: SLO monitoring, reliability programs, and the systems around them. Before this, I worked on experimentation infrastructure and ads performance systems at Meta.

Before joining Meta, I worked at Yelp on high-throughput logging and streaming pipelines built on Apache Kafka.

I’m most interested in distributed systems, practical engineering, and building software that behaves well under pressure.

Outside day-to-day work, I write here in different formats: essays, scribbles, stories, and poems.
