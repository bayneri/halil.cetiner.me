<p>
I had a dream<br>
It didn't have a great meaning<br>
I am not Martin<br>
<br>
A dream about things I can't say<br>
Not because of some kind of secrecy<br>
Things I can't say<br>
Because I have never said such things<br>
<br>
I was there again<br>
At an arm distance<br>
Your hand resting on the table<br>
Mine staying where it was<br>
<br>
If I were able to control my dreams<br>
I would never have a dream of such<br>
Not because I am a control freak<br>
Don't get me wrong<br>
I am a bit of a control freak<br>
But this is not about that<br>
<br>
Subconscious<br>
What an interesting word<br>
Crowded, full, messy<br>
Just as I remember<br>
</p>
